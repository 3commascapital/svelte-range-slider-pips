# Range Slider Component Testing

Test folder for trying out combinations of options while editing the plugin.

```bash
  cd test/
  yarn install
  yarn run dev
```

It's basic for now with just a large list of different sliders with different options to help identify anythingh broken.

If anyone has experience with how to do actual testing for UI components and wants to start
this off in the right direction, please get in touch using the issues feature!
